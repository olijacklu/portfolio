### Bachelor's Thesis - Statistics in Basketball: Settling NBA Debates analytically
[Publication](https://bodai.unibs.it/bdsports/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Tesi-OLIVER-JACK.pdf)

The primary goal of my work was to shed some light on some common NBA discussion topics, based solely on statistics. For that, I used several well-known analytical methods, such as Principal Component Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, k-means clustering and multiple linear regression.

After having logically developed my own player and team evaluation metrics (PPI & TPI), the main focus was to determine the greatest player and the greatest single season team of all-time. Overall, the analysis and metric values revealed that Michael Jordan can be considered as the GOAT, while the dominant 2016-2017 Golden State Warriors topped the charts in the team category.

Next, I attempted to identify and classify the key eras in NBA history, with the help of k-means clustering. According to the obtained results, the NBA seasons from 1980-2023 can be grouped into three eras, all having slightly different characteristics: the Classic Era (1980-1994), the Transitional Era (1995-2015) and the Modern Era (2016-2023).

By means of multiple linear regression, it turns out that all of the basic season stats, as well as the PER and the experience of a player, are statistically significant and explain approximately half of the variance, when it comes to determining the proportion of a player’s salary with respect to the annual salary cap.

Finally, some advanced analytical methods, such as shooting density estimation and the development of a true shooting performance measure, were presented, to give the reader an idea of how modern-day teams and players can benefit from basketball analytics.

On a personal note, I was able to get a first insight into collecting, manipulating and interpreting large sets of data, while doing research on a topic I thoroughly enjoy. Not only could I apply my previous Sports and Statistics knowledge to the research, I also learned several new data analysis techniques, such as PCA and MDS, which will undoubtedly be useful to me in the near future.
